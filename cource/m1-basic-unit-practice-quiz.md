# Practice Assignments: Basic Syntax and Idioms

Try these short coding exercises to practice what you've learned!  
Write each solution in your own Kotlin file, run it, and check the output.

### Assignment 1: Immutable Variable (`val`)
**Task:**  
Create a variable called `daysInWeek` with the value 7. Don't write the type â€” let Kotlin figure it out.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val daysInWeek = 7
    println("There are $daysInWeek days in a week.")
}
```

---

### Assignment 2: Mutable Variable (`var`)
**Task:**  
Make a variable called `userScore` with a starting value of 0. Add 10 to it and print the result.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var userScore = 0
    println("Initial score: $userScore")
    userScore += 10
    println("Final score: $userScore")
}
```

---

### Assignment 3: Arithmetic Operators
**Task:**  
Create `width` and `height` variables. Find the area of a rectangle.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val width = 5
    val height = 10
    val area = width * height
    println("The area of the rectangle is: $area")
}
```

---

### Assignment 4: Explicit Type Declaration
**Task:**  
Make a variable `pi` with type `Double` and value `3.14159`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val pi: Double = 3.14159
    println("The value of Pi is: $pi")
}
```

---

### Assignment 5: Single-Line Comment
**Task:**  
Add a comment explaining a variable that stores a user's name.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Stores the name of the currently logged-in user
    val userName = "Alex"
    println("User: $userName")
}
```

---

### Assignment 6: Remainder Operator (%)
**Task:**  
Check if the number 25 is even, and store the result in `isEven`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val number = 25
    val isEven = number % 2 == 0
    println("Is the number $number even? $isEven")
}
```

---

### Assignment 7: Template Strings
**Task:**  
Combine `firstName` and `lastName` into one variable called `fullName`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val firstName = "John"
    val lastName = "Doe"
    val fullName = "$firstName $lastName"
    println("Full name: $fullName")
}
```

---

### Assignment 8: `val` Reassignment Error
**Task:**  
Why does this code not compile? Fix it and explain in a comment.

```kotlin
// Original code with error
fun main() {
    val balance = 100
    balance = 120 // Error here
    println(balance)
}
```

```kotlin
// The error happens because 'val' makes the variable read-only.
// Use 'var' to make it changeable.
fun main() {
    var balance = 100
    balance = 120
    println("New balance: $balance")
}
```

---

### Assignment 9: Comparison Operators
**Task:**  
Check if `myAge` is enough to meet `requiredAge`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val myAge = 18
    val requiredAge = 21
    val canEnter = myAge >= requiredAge
    println("Can enter? $canEnter")
}
```

---

### Assignment 10: Multi-line Comment
**Task:**  
Describe the logic of code that calculates a price with a discount.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    /*
      This block calculates the final price after a discount.
      1. Set the base price.
      2. Set the discount percentage.
      3. Calculate the price after the discount.
    */
    val price = 200.0
    val discountPercentage = 15.0
    val finalPrice = price - (price * discountPercentage / 100)
    println("Final price: $finalPrice")
}
```

---

### Assignment 11: Choosing the Right Data Type
**Task:**  
Store whether a user is active. Pick the best type and assign `true`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Boolean is best for true/false.
    val isUserActive: Boolean = true
    println("User is active: $isUserActive")
}
```

---

### Assignment 12: Expression in a Template String
**Task:**  
Print a message about the temperature. If it's over 20, say "It is warm", otherwise say "It is cold".

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val temperature = 15
    println("It's $temperature degrees. ${if (temperature > 20) "It is warm." else "It is cold."}")
}
```

---

### Assignment 13: Combination of Operators
**Task:**  
Count apples in baskets and some extra apples.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val baskets = 3
    val applesPerBasket = 15
    val extraApples = 7
    val totalApples = baskets * applesPerBasket + extraApples
    println("Total apples: $totalApples")
}
```

---

### Assignment 14: Logical `&&` (AND) Operator
**Task:**  
See if the door can be opened: you need both a key and the password.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val hasKey = true
    val knowsPassword = false
    val canOpenDoor = hasKey && knowsPassword
    println("Can open the door? $canOpenDoor")
}
```

---

### Assignment 15: Increment Operator
**Task:**  
Increase `messageCount` by 1 and print the result.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    var messageCount = 99
    messageCount++
    println("New messages: $messageCount")
}
```
