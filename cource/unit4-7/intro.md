# Introduction

On our last lesson, we learned about how a Kotlin program is structured and what data types exist.  
We saw how to create variables and work with numbers, text, and Boolean values.

In this lesson, we will move forward and learn some very important building blocks of programming:

- **Conditional statements** (`if`, `else`, and `when`) — let your code make decisions and choose different actions based on conditions.
- **Loops** (`for`, `while`, `do...while`) — allow your program to repeat actions many times.
- **Ranges** — help us work with sequences of values (like numbers from 1 to 10).
- **Arrays** — let us store and work with lists of values, such as a group of numbers or names.

These topics are the foundation for writing real programs.  
They help your code:

- Make decisions (“What should I do if this is true?”)
- Repeat actions (“Do this for every item in a list”)
- Store and manage many values together

Once you understand these concepts, you’ll be able to solve much more interesting tasks and write more powerful programs.  
Let’s get started!
